# WHEN YOU ARE SUGGESTED TO APPEND/PUT SOME CODE IN YOUR BASHRC, TAKE THE
# FOLLOWING STEPS AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT:
#
# I     BASHRC IS NOT ALWAYS THE CORRECT PLACE TO PUT THOSE STUFF. FOR INSTANCE,
#       IF YOU INTENDED TO EXTEND YOUR PATH VARIABLE, THE BETTER/CORRECT PLACE
#       TO PUT THAT LINE IS YOUR BASH_PROFILE.
#
# II    STUFFING YOUR BASHRC WILL FINALLY MAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION
#       DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. THE WAY OF NIDUS IS TO SEPARATE THE CONFIGURATION
#       FILES BY TOPIC AND THEN SAVE THEM SEPARATELY. THEY ARE LOCATED AT
#       ~/.nidus_site_config/bash/rc/
#
# III   YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MODIFY THIS FILE ANYWAY. THIS FEATURE IS ONLY FOR
#       THOSE SOFTWARE INSTALLERS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALTER YOUR BASHRC. IF YOU
#       MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE, IT WILL TAKE EFFECT, BUT WITH THE CAVEAT
#       THAT THE CHANGES WILL LOST, WITH AUTOMATIC BACK UP TO ANOTHER PLACE, ON
#       NIDUS REINSTALLATION.
