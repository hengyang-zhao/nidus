# YOU CAN ALWAYS PUT STUFF IN THIS FILE AND IT WILL TAKE EFFECT.
#
# BASHRC OR THIS DIRECTORY IS NOT ALWAYS THE CORRECT PLACE TO PUT THE STUFF LIKE
# EXTENDING YOUR PATH VARIABLE, SINCE IN NESTED INTERACTIVE SHELL INVOCATIONS
# IT WILL BE AGAIN SOURCED AND THE PATH VARIABLE WILL BE EXTENDED MORE THAN ONE
# TIME WITH A SAME PATHLET. THE BETTER/CORRECT PLACE TO PUT THAT LINE IS YOUR
# BASH_PROFILE.

# AN EXAMPLE. FEEL FREE TO DELETE IT.
# THE PRINCIPLE IS, ONLY PUT CODE THAT IS INVULERABLE TO MULTIPLE EXECUTION AND
# ONLY INTENDED FOR ENHANCING INTERACTIVE BASH OPERATIONS.
