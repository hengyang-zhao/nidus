# WHEN YOU ARE SUGGESTED TO APPEND/PUT SOME CODE IN YOUR BASH PROFILE, TAKE THE
# FOLLOWING STEPS AND THEN DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT:
#
# I     BASH PROFILE IS NOT ALWAYS THE CORRECT PLACE TO PUT THOSE STUFF. FOR
#       INSTANCE, IF YOU INTENDED TO ENHANCE YOUR BASH INTERACTIVE OPERATIONS,
#       THE CORRECT/BETTER PLACE TO PUT THAT IS YOUR BASHRC.
#
# II    STUFFING YOUR BASH PROFILE WILL FINALLY MAKE YOUR ENVIRONMENT
#       CONFIGURATION DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. THE WAY OF NIDUS IS TO SEPARATE THE
#       CONFIGURATION FILES BY TOPIC AND THEN SAVE THEM SEPARATELY. THEY ARE
#       LOCATED AT
#
#       ~/.nidus_site_config/bash/profile/
#

# III   YOU ARE ALLOWED TO MODIFY THIS FILE ANYWAY. THIS FEATURE IS ONLY FOR
#       THOSE SOFTWARE INSTALLERS THAT AUTOMATICALLY ALTER YOUR BASH PROFILE.
#       IF YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THIS FILE, IT WILL TAKE EFFECT, BUT WITH THE
#       CAVEAT THAT THE CHANGES WILL LOST, WITH AUTOMATIC BACKUP TO ANOTHER
